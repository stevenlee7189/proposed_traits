    /// Handles a hot-join request from a device joining the bus dynamically.

    /// In an I3C bus system, devices can dynamically join the bus after it has already been initialized and is operational.
    /// This is known as a **hot-join**. Unlike I2C, which typically requires all devices to be present at initialization,
    /// I3C allows for more flexible and dynamic device management.
    ///
    /// This method is invoked by the I3C master when a new device signals its intent to join the bus. The master must then:
    /// - Detect the hot-join request.
    /// - Validate the new device’s presence and protocol compliance.
    /// - Assign a dynamic address (typically via `assign_dynamic_address`).
    /// - Update internal routing or device tables.
    ///
    /// # Typical flow
    /// 1. A device asserts a hot-join request on the bus.
    /// 2. The I3C master detects this and calls `handle_hot_join()`.
    /// 3. The method performs protocol-level checks and initiates dynamic address assignment.
    /// 4. If successful, the device becomes an active participant on the bus.
    ///
    /// # Errors

    /// - Address conflict
